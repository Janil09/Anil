            Raji is a fascinating character, played with great confidence by cast-against-type Samantha. Granted, she’s been slapped with a thick layer of brown face, but the actor relies on the physicality of Raji than more traditional tools, such as words and facial expressions. Notice the change in her body language as she transforms from a demure young woman into a lethal killer, in the span of virtually a couple of minutes.

As dependably formidable as Bajpayee is — and he is very formidable, exercising nearly every acting bone in his body — Samantha more than holds her own as the show’s primary antagonist. And what makes her journey so compelling is the very thing that makes The Family Man so compelling as a whole — the characters in this show aren’t motivated by requirements of the plot, but personal goals instead. In that regard, Raji is a textbook ‘villain’. Brainwashed as she might be, she is driven mainly by a desire to right the wrongs of her past -- it's a misplaced sense of righteousness, but as they say, the best villains are heroes in their own mind.
